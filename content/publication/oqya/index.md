abstract: 'Traits do not evolve independently, as genetic and developmental associations affect the variation that is expressed in populations and that is available for evolutionary change. In this chapter, we explore the causes and consequences of structured variation, introducing the concept of modularity, exploring some possible causes for modular organization in different levels, and, finally, discussing how the introduction of new variation can evolve.'
