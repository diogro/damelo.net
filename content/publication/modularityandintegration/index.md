abstract: 'Morphological integration refers to the relationships and connections among morphological elements, and is empirically recognized by detecting the existence of discrete groups of highly correlated traits, termed modules. The modular organization already observed in a variety of organisms is usually thought to be the outcome of functional and/or developmental relationships between traits. This article examines the concept of modularity and integration and discusses its origin from a genetic perspective. We also provide a historical overview on empirical studies investigating modular patterns and, finally, conclude with a few words about the potential impact of modularity in the evolutionary trajectory of populations/species.'
