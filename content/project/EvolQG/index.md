The EvolQG R package is a set of tools for evolutionary quantitative genetics we developed at the Mammal Evolution Lab at IB-USP.  It can be installed from CRAN or github and provides functions for dealing with co-variance matrices in an evolutionary quantitative genetics framework.

EvolQG implements the extension method for co-variance matrices, which controls noise in matrix estimation to improve estimates of selection gradients (described in Marroig et al. 2012); and the Selection Response Decomposition method of matrix comparisons from Marroig et al. 2011.
